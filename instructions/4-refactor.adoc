= 4. Refactor - 25 minutes

== Goals of this lab

The goal is to understand the modernization issues of the `customers` application and learn how you can fix them by the code modification. The MTA report also provides the details in terms of the *file name*, *path*, and *solution recommendations* for each issue. 

In this lab you will also analyze the customers application once again using MTA if the all issue are fixed.

== 4.1. Explore the Migration issues

According to the analysis report, the migration issues are related to external configurations with hard coded static IP addresses. Let's dig into the issue on the code level. 

Go to the web browser that opens the VS Code server. Explore the `customers-tomcat-legacy` project to open `PersistenceConfig.java` file in *src/main/java/io/konveyor/demo/ordermanagement/config* directory.

The *dataSource()* method creates an `ApplicationConfiguration` instance to configure the JDBC variables such as _driverClassName_, _url_, _user_, and _password_. The ApplicationConfiguration ends up with referring to the hard coded IP address in `persistence.properties`.

== 4.2. Understand the Solution

The `customers-tomcat-ocp` project implements the *Customers* application with all the required changes and deploy the applications to OpenShift (Kubernetes). It also defines an OpenShift manifests file in the `ocp` directory.

Let's find out how to fix the above configuration issue. Move to `customers-tomcat-ocp` project. Then, open `PersistenceConfig.java` file in *src/main/java/io/konveyor/demo/ordermanagement/config* directory and `pom.xml` file.

*ApplicationConfiguration* class isn't required anymore to configure the JDBC variables but the *datasource* method still needs to use the environment instance. When you take a look at the *pom.xml*, the static properties file will be excluded when the application is building.

Using the kubernetes profile in the build is essential for the application to pick up the configuration file injected via a secret in the pod. That secret also has to be  created manually which would normally be done by packaging with maven. To generate these _Kubernetes_ resources, you usually run the following maven command with the _Kubernetes_ profile.

[NOTE]
====
You don't need to run the following maven command today since you already have the solution artifact (`customers-tomcat-solution.war`) that are packaged with the fixed code by using the Kubernetes profile.
====

[source,sh]
----
mvn clean package -P kubernetes
----

Let's go back to the MTA web console. Then, create a new project to analyze the solution artifact. 

* Project name: `New Customers Service`

Select the `customers-tomcat-solution.war` file from your local file system in the *Add applications* page.

Configure the project with the same settings and custom rules that we used for the Customers Service project. Once the report is finished, verify that it now reports `0` Story Points.

You have successfully migrated this app and now ready to deploy to OpenShift, *congratulations!*
